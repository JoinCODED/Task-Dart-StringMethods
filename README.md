# String Methods 🔧

Given 1 variable

```dart
String fullName = " John doe";
```

Using string methods achieve this output:

```
My name is  JOHN and my last name length is 3
```

### 🍋 White Spaces

Open those [docs](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.16.1/dart-core/String-class.html) look for a string method that will get rid of the white spaces for us to achieve this output:

```
My name is  JOHN  and my last name length is 3
```

### 🌶 Does My Last Name Starts With The Letter d?

Using the same docs, look for a method that checks if the last name: `doe` starts with the letter `d`.

Output:

```
true
```
